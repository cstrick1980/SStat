# SStat
An old C++ statistics program I work.
I haven't worked on this in over a decade, it was a little program I use to use to do linear regression and
some simple statistics.  I thought I'd upload it, make it public if anyone can use any of the source code or
even make the program better and more useable.  Just include my name Christopher Alan Strickland is all I really
ask of anyone taking advantage of the source code.
